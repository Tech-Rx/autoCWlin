# Automated Passive Income System

## Setup Instructions

1. **Connect to Your VPS:**

   Use SSH to connect to your VPS.

2. **Download and Run `setup.sh`:**
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/absaro/autoCWlin/raw/main/setup.sh -O /root/setup.sh
   chmod +x /root/setup.sh
   /root/setup.sh
   ```
   Download the setup script from the GitHub repository, make it executable, and run it.

3. **Run `passive_income.sh`: (Optional, if you didn't run setup.sh)**
   ```bash
   /root/passive_income.sh
   ```
   This script is automatically executed by `setup.sh`. You can run it manually if needed.

## What `setup.sh` Installs and Configures

1. **Google Chrome**: Installs Google Chrome for browsing and interacting with websites.
2. **ChromeDriver**: Installs ChromeDriver to interface with Chrome via Selenium.
3. **Python3**: Installs Python3, which is required for running the Selenium scripts.
4. **Selenium**: Installs the Selenium Python library for browser automation.
5. **Git**: Installs Git to clone the repository.
6. **Docker**: Installs Docker for running passive income apps in containers.

### Additional Configuration

- **Schedules Scripts**: Configures a cron job to run the `run_all_scripts.sh` script daily.
- **Downloads and Configures Passive Income Apps**: The `passive_income.sh` script is downloaded and executed to set up Docker containers for passive income apps.

The `setup.sh` script is responsible for preparing the environment, installing necessary tools, and configuring everything to run your Selenium scripts and passive income apps.

## How to Set Up Passive Earning Apps

1. **Ensure Docker is Installed**: Docker will be installed by the `passive_income.sh` script.
2. **Configure Each App**: Edit the `credentials.sh` file with your credentials for each app.
3. **Run the Apps**: The `passive_income.sh` script will start and manage the containers for you.

### Notes

- Make sure to manually create `/root/credentials.sh` with the required format if you haven't already. The `credentials.sh` file in the repository should be modified with your sensitive information.
- Utilize free VPS resources effectively to generate passive income by configuring and running these scripts and applications.

For any issues or further customization, please refer to the scripts or consult the documentation of each application.
